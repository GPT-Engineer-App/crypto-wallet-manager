# crypto-wallet-manager

A personal website where visitors can select from one of 10 crypto blockchains, sign in to their own personal wallet for that block chain once it has been chosen, and manage their crypto currency (buy, sale, trade) from that blockchain dashboard after they choose it. Also create a "charts" tab, which will show users a singular graph with a live look at the top ten crypto coins and how they are moving in the market. Have each cryptocurrency on this graph by shown using a different color line and have a key at the bottom so users know which is which. Also include a tab called "profile" where users can add a wallet for a specific blockchain of their choosing, as well as log out or change notification settings. Also, include a tab called "exchange" that simply shows how much money they would receive at that very moment if they decided to exchange their crypto for another. On this tab, allow clients to select the cryptocurrency they want to exchange from their wallet, and on the other side with a double arrow pointing each direction in the middle, allow the user to select what they are exchanging the currency for. It could be another cryptocurrency or usd ($).
